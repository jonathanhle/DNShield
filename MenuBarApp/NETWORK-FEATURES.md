# Menu Bar App Network Features

## Overview

The DNShield menu bar app now displays real-time network information, providing users with visibility into their current network environment and DNS configuration.

## New Features

### 1. Network Display in Header
- Shows current WiFi network name (SSID) or interface name
- Replaces the generic "mode" display with actual network context
- Updates automatically when switching networks

### 2. Network Status Section
The Status tab now includes a dedicated "Network Status" section showing:
- **Network**: WiFi SSID or interface identifier
- **Interface**: Network interface (en0, en1, utun0, etc.)
- **Original DNS**: DNS servers that will be restored when paused

### 3. Network-Aware Pause/Resume
- When pausing protection, the app restores the correct DNS for your current network
- Each network's DNS settings are remembered separately
- Seamless transitions between different network environments

## User Benefits

### Home Network
- See "Home WiFi" in the menu bar
- Original DNS might be your router (192.168.1.1)
- Pause restores home router DNS

### Coffee Shop
- See "Starbucks WiFi" in the menu bar
- Original DNS might be ISP servers
- Pause restores coffee shop's DNS

### Office Network
- See corporate network name
- Original DNS might be company servers
- Maintains compliance with corporate DNS

### VPN Connection
- Detects VPN interfaces (utun0, etc.)
- Preserves VPN DNS configuration
- Handles connect/disconnect gracefully

## Technical Details

### API Integration
The menu bar app fetches network information from the DNShield API:
```json
{
  "current_network": "Home WiFi",
  "network_interface": "en0",
  "original_dns": ["192.168.1.1", "8.8.8.8"]
}
```

### Update Frequency
- Status updates every 5 seconds
- Network changes detected within 5-10 seconds
- Immediate updates on pause/resume actions

## Testing

1. **Build and Run Menu Bar App**:
   ```bash
   cd MenuBarApp/DNShieldStatusBar
   ./build.sh
   ```

2. **Verify Network Display**:
   - Click DNShield icon in menu bar
   - Check header shows current network
   - Navigate to Status tab
   - Verify Network Status section appears

3. **Test Network Switching**:
   - Switch between WiFi networks
   - Connect/disconnect ethernet
   - Enable/disable VPN
   - Verify display updates correctly

## Troubleshooting

### Network Not Showing
- Ensure DNShield is running with network manager enabled
- Check API is accessible at http://127.0.0.1:5353/api/status
- Verify network detection is working in DNShield logs

### Wrong Network Displayed
- Network detection based on SSID and gateway MAC
- Router changes may affect network identity
- Check ~/.dnshield/network-dns/ for saved configurations

### Original DNS Not Displayed
- Only shows if DNS was captured for current network
- New networks captured on first connection
- DHCP networks may show as empty (system default)
