# Network-Aware DNS Management & Smart Pause Functionality

## Summary

This PR implements comprehensive network-aware DNS management for DNShield, enabling intelligent handling of DNS settings across different network environments. The system now remembers and restores network-specific DNS configurations, making pause/resume functionality work correctly regardless of network changes.

## Key Features

### 1. Network-Aware DNS Management
- Automatically detects and tracks network changes (WiFi, Ethernet, VPN)
- Stores DNS configuration per network using unique network identifiers
- Seamlessly handles transitions between home, office, coffee shop networks
- Preserves both DHCP and static DNS configurations

### 2. Smart Pause/Resume
- Pause functionality now restores the correct DNS for the current network
- Each network's original DNS servers are preserved separately
- Automatic resume after specified duration (5min, 30min, 1hr)
- Graceful handling when switching networks while paused

### 3. Menu Bar App Integration
- Displays current network name (WiFi SSID) in the header
- Shows network information in the Status tab
- Visual indication of original DNS servers that will be restored
- Real-time updates as networks change

### 4. Enterprise Features
- Respects policy enforcement (allowPause configuration)
- Handles VPN connections appropriately
- Audit logging for all DNS configuration changes
- Zero-configuration for end users

## Technical Implementation

### New Components

1. **NetworkManager** (`internal/dns/network_manager.go`)
   - Replaces simple Manager for network-aware operations
   - Polls every 5 seconds for network changes
   - Stores configurations in `~/.dnshield/network-dns/`
   - Handles sleep/wake cycles automatically

2. **Network Identity System**
   - Unique network ID based on SSID + Gateway MAC + Interface
   - Tracks connection count and last seen time
   - Differentiates between similar network names

3. **API Enhancements**
   - Status endpoint includes current network info
   - Reports original DNS for current network
   - Menu bar app displays network context

### Changed Files

#### Core Implementation
- `internal/dns/network_manager.go` - New network-aware DNS manager
- `internal/dns/interfaces.go` - DNSManager interface definition
- `internal/dns/manager.go` - Updated simple manager with interface methods
- `internal/api/server.go` - Enhanced status endpoint with network info
- `cmd/run.go` - Initialize NetworkManager instead of simple Manager
- `cmd/install_ca.go` - Initialize network management during installation
- `internal/config/config.go` - Added `allowDisable` configuration

#### Menu Bar App
- `MenuBarApp/.../Models/Models.swift` - Added network fields to ServiceStatus
- `MenuBarApp/.../Views/StatusView.swift` - Display network information
- `MenuBarApp/.../Views/ContentView.swift` - Show current network in header
- `MenuBarApp/.../Views/ActivityView.swift` - Removed whitelist functionality
- `MenuBarApp/.../AppState.swift` - Initialize network fields properly

#### Documentation
- `docs/NETWORK-AWARE-DNS.md` - Comprehensive network management guide
- `docs/PAUSE-FUNCTIONALITY.md` - Updated pause/resume documentation
- `MenuBarApp/README.md` - Removed whitelist references
- `MenuBarApp/NETWORK-FEATURES.md` - Menu bar network features guide
- `README.md` - Updated features list

#### Testing & Configuration
- `test-network-aware.sh` - Test network detection and DNS management
- `test-pause.sh` - Test pause/resume functionality
- `test-menubar-network.sh` - Verify menu bar network display
- `test-pause.yaml` - Configuration with pause enabled

## Removed Features

- **User Whitelist**: Removed ability for end users to whitelist domains through menu bar app (enterprise security requirement)

## Testing

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Network Detection**
   ```bash
   sudo ./dnshield run --config test-pause.yaml
   ./test-network-aware.sh
   ```

2. **Pause/Resume**
   ```bash
   ./test-pause.sh
   ```

3. **Menu Bar App**
   ```bash
   cd MenuBarApp && ./build.sh
   ./test-menubar-network.sh
   ```

4. **Network Transitions**
   - Switch between WiFi networks
   - Connect/disconnect Ethernet
   - Enable/disable VPN
   - Sleep/wake Mac

### Expected Behavior

- DNShield captures DNS settings for each new network
- Pause restores that specific network's DNS
- Network changes are detected within 5-10 seconds
- Menu bar shows current network name
- Original DNS preserved even after restarts

## Migration Notes

- Existing installations will start capturing network DNS on first run
- No manual configuration required
- Backward compatible with simple DNS management

## Performance Impact

- Minimal: 5-second polling for network changes
- In-memory caching of network configurations
- Efficient file-based storage per network

## Security Considerations

- DNS configurations stored in user home directory
- No sensitive information exposed via API
- Pause functionality can be disabled via configuration
- All actions logged for audit trail
