## Summary by Phase

- **Phase 1 (Critical)**: 29 bugs - Missing implementations and remote exploits (22 fixed, 7 remaining)
- **Phase 2 (High)**: 87 bugs - Major security vulnerabilities and stability issues (9 fixed, 78 remaining)  
- **Phase 3 (Medium)**: 75 bugs - Core functionality and moderate security issues (3 fixed, 72 remaining)
- **Phase 4 (Low)**: 69 bugs - Performance and maintainability improvements
- **Phase 5 (Nice to Have)**: 45 bugs - Enhancements and polish
- **Phase 6 (Cosmetic)**: 22 bugs - Minor issues and edge cases

**Total**: 327 prioritized bugs (from original 500, with duplicates consolidated)

## Recommended Approach

1. **Immediate**: Fix all Phase 1 bugs before any further development
2. **Pre-Production**: Complete Phase 2 and Phase 3 bugs before any production deployment
3. **Post-Launch**: Address Phase 4 bugs in the first few sprints after launch
4. **Long-term**: Work on Phase 5 and 6 as time permits or as specific needs arise

## Notes

- Many bugs from the original list were duplicates or variations of the same issue
- Some bugs are interdependent - fixing one may resolve others
- Priority is based on security impact, functionality impact, and user experience
- Consider using automated tools (linters, security scanners) to catch similar issues going forward
